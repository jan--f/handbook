# Observability Operator

[Observability Operator](https://github.com/rhobs/observability-operator) is a Kubernetes operator created in Go to setup and manage multiple highly available Monitoring Stack using Prometheus and Thanos Querier.

Eventually, this operator may also cover Logging and Tracing.

The project relies heavily on the [controller-runtime](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/controller-runtime) library.
